## What was your goal today? (i.e . time spent studying, or improving certain skills) Did you accomplish it, and if not, what can you do differently next time?

Today, I had a qualifying interview in order to enter my coding bootcamp's post-graduate program called the Career Accelerator Program. Thus, my main goal today was to be able to prepare for that and future interviews by organizing my stories for behavioral questions, curate my list of companies that I'm targeting, and preparing questions to ask interviewers.

## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Today, most of my time went towards preparing for the qualifying interview and general career prep. Aside from that, I did look into understanding what content management systems (CMS) do and whether it would be worth integrating into a blog since many Astro templates seem to encourage it.

Ultimately, as I decided on Friday, I'm planning to prioritize my work on PicMySong and revert my blog set-up to my previous set-up using Hugo as it was already working. Once I have 1-2 projects in a good place, I'd like to come back to the idea of possibly creating a single portfolio / blog site to share my projects and general process.

## What do you plan to work on tomorrow?

Tomorrow, I plan to continue my work with the AWS Rekognition API and hopefully get that off the ground and running.
