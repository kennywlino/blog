## What was your goal today? Did you accomplish it, and if not, what can you do differently next time?

Today, my main goal was to set up the AWS Rekognition API and create an endpoint to process images with Express. I also wanted to deploy my Astro blog today and set up a workflow for my posts.

I wasn't able to finish either task today as the set-up for both were more involved than I expected. However, I did spend a full workday again today so I'd like to continue spending time on these tasks.

## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Today was certainly a day where I spent more time trying to decipher what I wanted to do more than being able to hit the ground running. For example, with the blog, even though my plan was to use a template to make things happen more quickly and smoothly, I'm finding that there were more steps involved than I expected. Previously, I was using a Hugo-based blog hosted on GitHub pages for ease which was nice because I could quickly write my content in markdown, push and have it published.

Instead, with Astro, at least with the template I'm using, they suggest using a CMS for posts, so I spent time looking into those. I couldn't decide if a CMS was a little overkill or not, but I'd like to look into it a little more.

With AWS Rekognition, it took some time understanding the overall set-up with using the AWS SDK and figuring out what functions need what inputs in order to function correctly. That coupled with my initial back-end set-up with TypeScript really dampened my development time since I kept running into type errors. I was hoping that maybe I could pick-up more TypeScript along the way as I built this project, but it's looking like it might be better if I put that to the side and went back to plain JavaScript so I can develop faster.

## What are some things you'd like to make special note of?

Today, I spent more time focused on figuring out the AWS set-up, so I don't have much to make note of.

## What are some things you're still curious about?

Although I've learned about the differences between CommonJS and ES6, I am a little curious about why both tend to still be in use today. That along with the addition of TypeScript makes understanding what the best practices are, but I also understand that it's also a matter of preference to a certain extent since everything can be transpiled.

On the other hand, given that everything can be transpiled, I wish there was more consistency similar to how Python had Python 2 and Python 3, and eventually sunsetted Python 2 and moved everyone over to Python 3. Although JS has its need for backwards compatibility, I think there must be a way for everyone to use more similar syntax.

### 5. What do you plan to work on tomorrow?

Tomorrow, I plan on working on preparing for my Code Fellows Qualifying Interview by reviewing some behavioral questions and preparing a list of companies I'm interested in. I also will be revising my resum√© a bit and updating my profiles on GitHub and LinkedIn to better reflect some of the skills I've acquired.

I then plan to continue working on setting up the AWS Rekognition API and deciding the best course of action to get the blog up and going as soon as possible.
