## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Recently, I've diverted my attention from PicMySong to working on Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course.  

This was a course I purchased late last year around Black Friday I believe, because there was a great deal going on. I have to say though, I have been completely sucked in by this course! In the past week, I've completed both Chapter 1 where we cover the basics, and Chapter 2 where we cover classic techniques. Together, the videos total to about 16 hours of content! 

Before I go into more detail, I should describe what Three.js does. Three.js is a JavaScript 3D library that allows us to render via WebGL. If that doesn't make sense, feel free to click [this link](https://3d-text-kenny.vercel.app/), as they say, a picture is a worth a 1000 words! 

## What are some things you'd like to make special note of?

Today, I wanted to acknowledge my gap between this learning journal and the last. More importantly, I think I wanted to acknowledge my mental health and journey as I work towards what I'm most interested in doing. Last week in particular was a bit difficult for me, partially because I needed to start thinking of my finances and partially because I started to think a bit about what my overall goals are, especially with the tech market being so competitive these days. Because of that, I got less work done, but also had the chance to think through some of my challenges.

I mentioned above I started working on Three.js Journey. While I do plan to give PicMySong its proper closure, I was starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by the idea of spending too much time working on the same project. I think I also was becoming a bit anxious about feeling prepared to apply to jobs and not having enough projects, or having projects that were just too inferior to other applicants. 

When I tried to reframe my approach to my transition to becoming a software developer, I realized that something I had been trying to highlight for a while is my urge to incorporate creativity with tech. This relates to things they asked during my coding bootcamp, such as "What is your why?" or "What motivates you?" Even in my "headline", I say that I have "a passion for creating intuitive applications and tools that provide users with a memorable and positive experience". Having full-stack skills now makes me appreciate being able to see an application all the way through, but ultimately I want to spend more time on the front-end and the overall experience of a webpage. 

Comparing that to some of the other things I had in mind like learning TypeScript, GraphQL, AWS, etc. I realized that while those tools would surely be added bonuses on my resum√©, they don't add to my goal for creativity. Having more unique skills also seemed like that would be an added plus, but even better, Three.js has just been complete fun!
