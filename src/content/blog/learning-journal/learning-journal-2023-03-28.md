## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Recently, I've diverted my attention from PicMySong to working on Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course. While I do plan to give PicMySong its proper closure, I was starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by the idea of spending too much time working on the same project. I think I also was becoming a bit anxious about feeling prepared to apply to jobs and not having enough projects, or having projects that were just too inferior to other applicants. 

When I tried to reframe my approach to my transition to becoming a software developer, I realized that something I had been trying to highlight for a while is my urge to incorporate creativity with tech. This relates to things they asked during my coding bootcamp, such as "What is your why?" or "What motivates you?" Even in my "headline", I say that I have "a passion for creating intuitive applications and tools that provide users with a memorable and positive experience". Having full-stack skills now makes me appreciate being able to see an application all the way through, but ultimately I want to spend more time on the front-end and the overall experience of a webpage. 

Comparing that to some of the other things I had in mind like learning TypeScript, GraphQL, AWS, etc. I realized that while those tools would surely be added bonuses on my resum√©, they don't add to my goal for creativity. 

## What are some things you'd like to make special note of?
