## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Today, I worked on trying to integrate Tina's [Contextual Editing](https://tina.io/docs/contextual-editing/react/ "") into my website. However, as I started to work on using Tina's data fetching, I first noticed that I couldn't get the Tina-provided GraphQL client to work. I then also realized that there was a bug with not being able to save posts using the Tina interface, which was quite troublesome as it had been working when I had initially set everything up.

I ended up diverting my focus from the contextual editing to spend some time troubleshooting the bug and looking for resources on the Tina GitHub discussions and their Discord. In the end, while it felt good to be resourceful, I couldn't find a lot of mentions of people having similar issues, so I figured the best approach would be to incrementally rebuild the Tina config.

## What are some things you'd like to make special note of?

## What are some things you're still curious about?

## What do you plan to work on tomorrow?

Tomorrow, I plan on finishing investigating the Tina bug and hopefully get the Tina interface up and running again. I also plan to update the page with some small touches like adding social media buttons.
