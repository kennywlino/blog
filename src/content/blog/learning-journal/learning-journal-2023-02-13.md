## What was your goal today? (i.e . time spent studying, or improving certain skills) Did you accomplish it, and if not, what can you do differently next time?

Today, my goal was to work on a coding challenge, do some research regarding image recognitions APIs, and finish setting up and deploying my blog with my learning journal created with Astro.

## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Today, I learned about how to set up a shortcut within VSCode for any custom scripts since Astro doesn't seem to come with an easy way to create new posts with the YAML prefilled. When I was using Hugo for a blog, there was a VSCode plugin that made it easy to make new posts via a Command Palette command.
