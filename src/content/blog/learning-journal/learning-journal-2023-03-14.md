## What did you learn or work on today? How does it tie into your goals?

Today, I worked the front-end of PicMySong. I spent some time figuring out how to get a transition going on the icons I have in my hero section. I was trying to get a transition where the icon of a picture would change into a picture of a CD to represent a song. This took me a bit longer than I anticipated, as I saw [suggestions](http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/cfimg/ "suggestions") like stacking the images and then changing the opacity of the top image to be 0 on hover.

## What are some things you'd like to make special note of?

## What are some things you're still curious about?

## What do you plan to work on tomorrow?
